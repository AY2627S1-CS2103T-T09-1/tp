* The project uses the `java.util.logging` package for logging.
* `LogsCenter` manages logging levels and destinations.
* A class obtains a `Logger` with `LogsCenter.getLogger(Class)`, which logs messages at the configured level.
* Log messages are written to the console and rotating `tuteebook3.log.*` files in the home folder. The current file is `tuteebook3.log.0`, and up to five files are kept.
* Log messages include each command as typed, so they can contain student and guardian details.
* The output logging level can be controlled by changing the `LOG_LEVEL` constant in the `LogsCenter` class.
* **When choosing a level for a log message**, follow the conventions given in [_[se-edu/guides] Java: Logging conventions_](https://se-education.org/guides/conventions/java/logging.html).
